5. Summarize your data using descriptive statistics.
6. Understand the relationships in your data using correlations.
7. Review the skew of the distributions of each attribute.

**Tips To Remember**
- **Review the numbers** - Generating the summary statistics is not enough. take a moment to pause, read and really think about the numbers you are seeing
- **Ask why** - Review your numbers and ask a lot of questions. How and why are you seeing specific numbers. Think about how the numbers relate to the problem domain in general and specific entities that observations relate to.
- **Write down ideas** - Write down you4r observations and ideas. Keep a small text file or note pad and jot down all of the ideas for how variables may relate, for what numbers mean, and ideas for techniques to try later. The things you write down now while the data is fresh will be very valuable later when you are trying to think up new things to try.
