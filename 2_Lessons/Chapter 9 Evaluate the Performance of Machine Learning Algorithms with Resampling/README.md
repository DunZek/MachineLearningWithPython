# Chapter 9 - Evaluate the Performance of Machine Learning Algorithms with Resampling

You need to know well algorithms perform on test/unseen data.
- The best way to evaluate algorithm performance is to test it.
- The second best way is to use clever techniques from statistics called resampling methods which allows us to accurately know how well an algorithm will perform on new data.

### 9.1 Evaluate Machine Learning Algorithms
- We don't simply evaluate an algorithm based on its predictions because of *overfitting*.
